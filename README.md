## ðŸ“Š Workflow Overview

- **Generate Sample Data**
  - Create 2,000 transactions with columns like:
    - `date`

- **Enhance Data**
  - Add a `total_sale` column (revenue per transaction).
  - Extract date-based features: **day of week**, **month**, **hour of day**.

- **Analyze**
  - Find **best-selling drinks** (ranked by revenue, sold quantity, and rating).
  - Identify **daily business patterns** (revenue and transaction counts).
  - Filter **big orders** (transactions over \$10).
  - Analyze **customer behavior** (average spending, revenue, visit count, satisfaction).

- **Business Summary**
  - Output key metrics:
    - Total revenue
    - Total transactions
    - Average transaction value
